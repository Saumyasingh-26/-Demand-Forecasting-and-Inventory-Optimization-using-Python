# -Demand-Forecasting-and-Inventory-Optimization-using-Python


This project demonstrates how to use time series forecasting techniques to predict product demand and optimize inventory decisions using Python. The model uses SARIMA for forecasting and calculates optimal order quantities, reorder points, and safety stock based on forecasted demand.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Efficient inventory management is crucial for reducing costs and avoiding stockouts. In this project, we:

- Analyze daily product demand data
- Forecast future demand using SARIMA
- Calculate inventory parameters like:
  - 🔁 Reorder Point
  - 📦 Optimal Order Quantity
  - 🛡️ Safety Stock
  - 💰 Total Cost (holding + stockout)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** for demand forecasting
- **Newsvendor Model** for inventory optimization
- **Statistical measures** for cost evaluation
